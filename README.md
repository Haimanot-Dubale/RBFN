Radial basis function
A radial basis function network is a type of supervised artificial neural network that uses supervised machine learning (ML) to function as a nonlinear classifier. Nonlinear classifiers use sophisticated functions to go further in analysis than simple linear classifiers that work on lower-dimensional vectors.

A radial basis function network is also known as a radial basis network.
